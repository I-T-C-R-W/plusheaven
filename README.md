Proof Of Concept

WEB 3 CASINO GAME

Why is a decentralized game better than a centralized one?

A lot of countries don’t allow gambling. Using the blockchain, you close the risks. The money from your card goes to buy cryptocurrencies, but where it goes next is no longer tracked. 


The problem that our project solves?

Purity and transparency
- All betting information is stored on the smart contract 
- We do not hide the financial situation of our application. Players can make sure that we can pay out winnings for them by looking at our smart contract
- Also, anyone can view transactions and payments to other players
- In traditional online casinos, most of the in-game information is hidden from the user. Consequently, the results are not immune from manipulation. We ensure transparency of transactions, winnings, and the course of the game.
Blockchain makes the entire gameplay and algorithms transparent: transactions of both the player and the casino are displayed on the blockchain.


Rapidity
- Fast transactions - fast money withdrawal. There are no payout-limits. We do not collect any interest for the bets or the withdrawal of funds (you can verify by looking at the smart contract)

Easy to use
- No need to pass a verification or submit any documents
- simple beting interface 
- safe transations
- tranparent by design
- secure in payouts
